    <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
    <p1>Leonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] ("Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci
        "),[9][10][c] was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from 
        Florence.[11][12][d] He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci
        (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504),[16] a Florentine legal notary,
         11] and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c. 1434–1494), from the lower class.[17][18][e] It remains uncertain
        where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian
        Emanuele Repetti,[21] is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered 
        sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in
        Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had.[22][a] Leonardo's parents both married separately the 
        year after his birth. Caterina – who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" or
         Catelina" – is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan
        Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one'.[17][21] Ser Piero
        married Albiera Amadori – having been betrothed to her the previous year – and after her death in
        1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages.[21][23][f] From all the marriages, Leonardo
         ventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy)[24] who were much younger than
        he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old)[24] and with whom he had very little 
        contact
